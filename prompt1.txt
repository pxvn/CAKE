Certainly! Here's a precise prompt for you to use as a checkpoint:

Prompt:

Checkpoint for CAKE Robot Project

Objective:
Continue improving the control and stability of the CAKE robot, addressing the following issues:

Changes and Edits from Start to End:

Fixed Movement Directions:
Corrected the movement commands to ensure:
Forward: moveWheels(currentSpeed, -currentSpeed)
Backward: moveWheels(-currentSpeed, currentSpeed)
Left: moveWheels(-currentSpeed, -currentSpeed)
Right: moveWheels(currentSpeed, currentSpeed)
Improved Tilt Mechanics:
Implemented detailed tilt mechanics:
Left Tilt:
Move Right Leg to 650.
Slightly Delayed Left Leg to 570.
Move Right Leg to 650 again.
Right Tilt:
Move Left Leg to 390.
Slightly Delayed Right Leg to 470.
Move Right Leg to 350.
Added buttons to return to standing mode after tilt without auto-reverting.
Allowed maneuver buttons (Forward, Backward, Right, Left) to be used while in tilt mode.
Speed Control:
Added speed presets (Slow, Medium, Fast) selectable via UI.
Applied selected speed to all maneuvers and mode changes.
Smooth Movement:
Implemented gradual wheel start/stop using rampPWM function with a 200ms ramp time.
Balance:
Added checks to ensure servo positions are within valid range (0-1023).
Disabled torque after securing the standing position.
Re-enabled torque when transitioning to other modes or during maneuvers.
Boot Positioning:
Positioned servos 1 and 3 to 1000 at boot with fast speed.
Battery Percentage:
Added functionality to fetch and display battery percentage from servo feedback.
Torque Management:
Added a torque on/off button and documented its behavior and characteristics in different situations.
Issues to Address:

Smooth Transitions Between Modes:
Make transitions between standing and wheel modes smooth to prevent backward falls.
Ensure smooth transitions in maneuver commands (Forward, Backward, Right, Left) when the robot is in wheel mode.
Tilt Left Angle:
Adjust the angle for the left tilt to ensure it works correctly.
Fetch Battery Voltage:
Fetch battery voltage ('v') from servo feedback and display it in the status update.
Smooth Maneuvers in Wheel Mode:
Implement smooth transitions (ramp up and down speed) for maneuvers (Forward, Backward, Right, Left) when the robot is in wheel mode.
Torque On/Off Behavior:
Ensure torque on/off is properly enabled/disabled to prevent backward falls during transitions.
Current State:

All maneuvers are working fine.
All speed options are working.
Transition between modes are jerky and laggy.
Tilt right angle is working fine.
Tilt left angle is not optimal.
Torque on/off might not be properly enabled, causing backward falls during transitions.
Next Steps:

Implement smooth transitions between modes.
Adjust the left tilt angle.
Fetch and display battery voltage from servo feedback.
Implement smooth transitions for maneuvers in wheel mode.
Ensure proper torque management to prevent backward falls during transitions.
